Welcome to my GitHub page! 

This repo shows off code samples from classes I completed at the University of Pennsylvania and also personal projects I am working on.

__Languages/frameworks/tools__: Java (_primary_), Python, C, Flask, Django, Markdown, SciKit-Learn, Matplotlib, Pandas, Apache FOP, Twitter4J


## Highlights

### 596HW7_Maze:

A project that creates a visual representation (as a maze) of a __minimum-spanning-tree (MST)__ using __Kruskal's algorithm__. This is accomplished via the __path compression__ and __union-by-rank__ heuristics outlined in CLRS. Lastly, the `mazeviewer.java` class allows you to see the maze traversal either by __breadth first search (BFS)__ or __depth-first search (DFS)__. 

### Bikeshare\_Data\_Analysis:

I used a __dataset__ from Philadelphia's bicycle sharing program Indego (stored as a __CSV file__). The project parses the data and offers a __user interface__ (`IndegoUserInterface.java`) that provides several statistics given the data (number of trips in a year, longest distance of a trip, the day when usage was highest, etc.).

### RecommendationSystem:



### Twitter\_Streaming\_Product\_Tracking:
 
 My final project for my introduction to programming class. I used __Twitter4J__ and the __Watson API__ to stream tweets from __Twitter__ that mentioned a target product. I then attempted to striate tweets based on target characteristics (location, sentiment, date, etc.).
