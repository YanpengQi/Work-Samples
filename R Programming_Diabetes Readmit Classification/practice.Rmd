Description of variables

The dataset used covers ~50 different variables to describe every hospital diabetes admission. In this section we give an overview and brief description of the variables in this dataset.

|Category|Variable|Description|
|--------|--------|-----------|
|Patient identifiers|`encounter_id`|unique identifier for each admission: - this -that|

**a) Patient identifiers:** 

a. `encounter_id`: unique identifier for each admission 
b. `patient_nbr`: unique identifier for each patient 

**b) Patient Demographics:** 

`race`, `age`, `gender`, `weight` cover the basic demographic information associated with each patient. `Payer_code` is an additional variable that identifies which health insurance (Medicare /Medicaid / Commercial) the patient holds.

**c) Admission and discharge details:** 

a.	`admission_source_id` and `admission_type_id` identify who referred the patient to the hospital (e.g. physician vs. emergency dept.) and what type of admission this was (Emergency vs. Elective vs. Urgent). 
b.	`discharge_disposition_id` indicates where the patient was discharged to after treatment.

**d) Patient Medical History:**

a.	`num_outpatient`: number of outpatient visits by the patient in the year prior to the current encounter
b.	`num_inpatient`: number of inpatient visits by the patient in the year prior to the current encounter
c.	`num_emergency`: number of emergency visits by the patient in the year prior to the current encounter

**e)	Patient admission details:**

a.	`medical_specialty`: the specialty of the physician admitting the patient
b.	`diag_1`, `diag_2`, `diag_3`: ICD9 codes for the primary, secondary and tertiary diagnoses of the patient.  ICD9 are the universal codes that all physicians use to record diagnoses. There are various easy to use tools to lookup what individual codes mean (Wikipedia is pretty decent on its own)
c.	`time_in_hospital`: the patientâ€™s length of stay in the hospital (in days)
d.	`number_diagnoses`: Total no. of diagnosis entered for the patient
e.	`num_lab_procedures`: No. of lab procedures performed in the current encounter
f.	`num_procedures`: No. of non-lab procedures performed in the current encounter
g.	`num_medications`: No. of distinct medications prescribed in the current encounter

**f)	Clinical Results:**

a.	`max_glu_serum`: indicates results of the glucose serum test
b.	`A1Cresult`: indicates results of the A1c test

**g)	Medication Details:**

a.	`diabetesMed`: indicates if any diabetes medication was prescribed 
b.	`change`: indicates if there was a change in diabetes medication
c.	`24 medication variables`: indicate whether the dosage of the medicines was changed in any manner during the encounter

**h)	Readmission indicator:** 

Indicates whether a patient was readmitted after a particular admission. There are 3 levels for this variable: "NO" = no readmission, "< 30" = readmission within 30 days and "> 30" = readmission after more than 30 days. The 30 day distinction is of practical importance to hospitals because federal regulations penalize hospitals for an excessive proportion of such readmissions.
